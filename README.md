# Multi-Feature Python Program: Calculator, BMI Calculator, Temperature Converter & More!

This is one of the projects I built while learning Python fundamentals. 🚀
It’s a simple but useful program that includes:

## Feature and How It Works
# When you run the program, you’ll see a main menu with different options:
**Calculator** – Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
**Grading System** – Input a score, and the program will categorize it into "Kurang", "Bagus", or "Terbaik".
**BMI Calculator**– Enter your weight and height, and the program calculates your BMI with health feedback.
**Temperature Converter** – Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, Reamur, and Kelvin.
**Internet Café Billing** – Simulates a pricing system with discounts based on usage duration.

# Navigation & User Input Handling
Users enter a number (1-5) to select a feature.
After completing an operation, they can choose to go back to the main menu or repeat the process.
The program validates inputs, ensuring smooth operation without errors.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)
Basic Arithmetic & Logical Operations

I wanted to challenge myself with something a bit more interactive. This project is a multi-functional Python program that combines different real-world applications into one simple command-line interface.

This isn't just a basic calculator – it also helps with grading, BMI calculations, temperature conversions, and even a simple billing system for an internet café (Warnet).

## How it Built
Uses Python loops (while) to keep the menu interactive.
Implements if-elif-else conditions to execute the correct function.

I built this project to sharpen my Python skills and get comfortable with logic-based programming before moving on to bigger challenges. 🚀

🔧 Technologies Used
🟢 Python – The core language used to build this interactive CLI application.
🟢 Conditional Statements & Loops – Using if-elif-else, while, break, and continue for decision-making.
🟢 Mathematical & Logical Operations – Handling calculations for arithmetic, BMI, and grading.
🟢 User Input Handling & Validation – Ensuring smooth user interaction and preventing errors.
