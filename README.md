# Python-Practice-Project-Math-Operations-Score-Evaluation-BMI-Calculation

This is one of the projects I built while learning Python fundamentals. ðŸš€
Itâ€™s a simple but useful program that includes:

## Features:
**A Math Calculator** â€“ Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
**Grading System** â€“ Categorizes task scores into different levels (kurang, bagus, terbaik).
**BMI Calculator** â€“ Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides weight category feedback.

## How It Works
# Math Calculator:
Users can select an operation (1-4).
Inputs two numbers.
Gets the calculated result.
# Grading System:
User enters a task score.
The system categorizes the score based on set conditions.

# BMI Calculator:
User inputs weight (kg) and height (cm).
The system calculates BMI and provides weight status feedback.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)
Basic Arithmetic & Logical Operations
